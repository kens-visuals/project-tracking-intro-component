- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In the [Blogr Landing Page](https://kens-visuals.github.io/blogr-landing-page/), there were sections similar to this project. The image was slightly out of the screen and when I was first implementing it, the part was a bit frustrating for me. However, that experience helped me to build this project a lot faster and a lot cleaner. This was the last small project of this level, the rest are whole landing pages. And I've got only 5 projects left to finish this level completely. I'm going to finish them by the end of the year.

- [CSS Box Shadows](https://getcssscan.com/css-box-shadow-examples) - My go to place for some cool CSS box-shadows.
